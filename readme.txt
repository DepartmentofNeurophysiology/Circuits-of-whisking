A network model of adaptive whisking

This code provides a graph based network model of whisking. Sensory exploration and motor control are coupled processes. Considering that lack of adaptive whisking reduces mechanical forces traveling along whiskers upon whisker touch (Fig.3), this change in the sensory drive could potentially alter the motor control of whisker position in subsequent whisk cycles. This project allows addressing this question, without the confounding variables (including compensatory change in body position) of navigation in freely behaving animals.

A computational circuit that could perform adaptive sensorimotor control necessarily requires information from sensory circuits about the stimulus availability as well as motor control circuits that perform phase to motor signal transformation given the current state of the sensory information. Based on the known coding properties of the neurons along sensorimotor circuits, and the connectivity between them, the graph network consists of the following nodes: primary somatosensory cortex (S1; barrel cortex) where stimulus properties are encoded; 2) primary motor cortex (M1) which provides adaptive motor control for whisker protraction, through recursively adjusting the amplitude and midpoint of whisking envelope; 3) central pattern generators (CPGs) that control phasic motion of whiskers; 4) superior colliculus (SC) which translates phase and amplitude information to motor control commands for facial motor nucleus (FMN) to drive whisking; 5) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) that regulates excitability in cortical and subcortical (sensorimotor) nuclei (59); and 6) a control circuit, plausibly the barrel cortex, that triggers whisker retraction upon stimulation to maintain touch duration. In this model output of each node is a transfer function rather than a time and/or rate varying action potentials. Please note that the aim of this model is not to mechanistically explain how the brain performs sensorimotor computation, it is rather to provide the minimal circuit requirements for adaptive control of whisker position.
